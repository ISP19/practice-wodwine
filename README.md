# Github Classroom Practice

The usual workflow for doing an assignment on Github classroom is:

1. Accept the assignment by visiting a URL given by the instructor.
    - Github will create a new repository for you and show a link to your repo URL.
    - The assignment repository may be *empty* or may contain *starter code* (like this README).
2. Go the the URL of your assignment repo on Github and copy the URL.
3. Clone it to your computer.
4. Do the assignment.
5. Add your work to your local repo, commit, and push everything to Github (the "remote").

## Practice

- Clone this repo (probably you did that already).
- Add some files, edit this README locally.
- Commit your work and "push" to Github.
- Use a web browser to view it on Github.  Does it contain what you expect?

## Practice Again

You should be able to do the above quickly during a quiz. Practice will make it easier and faster.

To repeat this exercise, delete your repos (both locally and on Github):

- go to your assignment repo on Github.
- click the "Settings" icon (gear)
- At the bottom of the Settings screen in "Danger Zone" where you can delete the Github repo.
- Delete your local clone, too.

Now you can go back to the assignment URL and accept the assignment again.
Github will create a new repo.

## Alternate Workflow for Empty Github Repository

On some assignments, the Github repo for the assignment may be **empty**.

In that case you can still clone it (and get an empty dir), or follow Github's
instructions for creating a local git repo and then adding Github as a "remote".

You can practice that by going to Github and creating an empty repo in your own account.
Now, can you create a local repo (`git init`), add Github as remote,
and push stuff to it?
